        <p>Grilled chicken is a flavorful and juicy dish thatâ€™s perfect for any occasion, whether itâ€™s a summer barbecue
            or a simple weeknight dinner. The key to achieving a delicious result lies in marinating the chicken with a
            blend of herbs, spices, and a touch of acidity to enhance tenderness and depth of flavor. Once marinated,
            the chicken is cooked over a hot grill, allowing the exterior to develop a beautiful char while keeping the
            inside moist and succulent. Turning the chicken at the right intervals ensures even cooking, and a final
            resting period helps the juices redistribute for maximum taste. Served alongside fresh vegetables, rice, or
            a zesty dipping sauce, this dish is both satisfying and versatile.</p>
