    <p>Grilled chicken is a flavorful and juicy dish that’s perfect for any occasion, whether it’s a summer barbecue or a simple weeknight dinner. The key to achieving a delicious result lies in marinating the chicken with a blend of herbs, spices, and a touch of acidity to enhance tenderness and depth of flavor. Once marinated, the chicken is cooked over a hot grill, allowing the exterior to develop a beautiful char while keeping the inside moist and succulent. Turning the chicken at the right intervals ensures even cooking, and a final resting period helps the juices redistribute for maximum taste. Served alongside fresh vegetables, rice, or a zesty dipping sauce, this dish is both satisfying and versatile.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>In a food processor, blend butter, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, and lemon juice together. Pour 1/3 of the blended mixture into a small bowl for marinade. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Lightly season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Rub chicken breasts with marinade. Place chicken breasts on a platter, cover, and refrigerate for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer half of the reserved rosemary and lemon mixture into a bowl for basting. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside for topping cooked chicken.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken breasts on hot grill, basting with rosemary and lemon basting mixture, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken breasts from the grill, and top with remaining rosemary and lemon mixture.</li>
