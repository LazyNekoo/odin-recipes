    <p>GSalmon cakes are a delicious and versatile dish that combines flaky salmon with a blend of seasonings, herbs, and binding ingredients to create crispy, golden-brown patties. The mixture is carefully formed into cakes and pan-seared until they develop a crunchy exterior while remaining moist and tender inside. A hint of citrus or a creamy sauce can enhance the flavor, adding brightness and balance to each bite. These salmon cakes can be served as an appetizer, a main course with a fresh salad, or even in a sandwich for a tasty twist. Easy to prepare and packed with protein, they make for a satisfying and flavorful meal.</p>
