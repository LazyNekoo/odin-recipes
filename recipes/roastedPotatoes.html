    <p>Roasted red potatoes are a simple yet delicious side dish that pairs well with a variety of meals. The potatoes are cut into bite-sized pieces and tossed with olive oil, herbs, and seasonings to enhance their natural flavor. Roasting them in a hot oven allows the edges to crisp up beautifully while keeping the inside soft and fluffy. Turning them halfway through cooking ensures an even golden-brown finish. A final sprinkle of fresh herbs or a dash of Parmesan cheese can add an extra layer of flavor. Perfect for complementing roasted meats, grilled vegetables, or even as a standalone snack, these potatoes are a crowd-pleaser with minimal effort.</p>
